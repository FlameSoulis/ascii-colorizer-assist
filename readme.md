# ASCII Colorizer Assistant
### A simple Python script for adding color for [fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch) sources

This script allows the creation of a numbered color guide from an ASCII art text file. This can then be merged back together, allowing easier complex coloring for fastfetch.

Project established in part of [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev?bannerlord=flamesoulis)'s course work.
